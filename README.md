# delaware-covid-analysis

The .m files in this repository were created in MATLAB_R2020a

If downloaded, the programs should function properly in MATLAB_R2020a.

The files in this repository:
finalDailyDelaware.m (the program that fits the daily Delaware cases data into the model y = ae ^ kt)
firstmodelCumulativeDelaware.m (the program that fits the cumulative Delaware cases data into the the model y = ae ^ kt)
finalCumulativeDelaware.m (the program that fits the cumulative Delaware cases data into the model y = ae ^ kt + b)
estimateCalc.m (the function used by finalCumulativeDelaware.m, this function provides the estimates for each 14-day modeling window)

Attached in the repository there also exists a PDF (AtabasDelawareCovidReport.pdf) of a final report synthesizing the data and comparing the results to real events in the state of Delaware. All figures used in the report are also attached.
